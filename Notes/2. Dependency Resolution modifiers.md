## Resolution Modifiers:

Resolution modifiers are some special annotations which allow you to slightly **change the logic of how angular resolves dependency in the injectors tree**.

There are four resolution modifiers in angular: @Optional(), @Self() @SkipSelf() and @Host().

**@Optional**:

So, when angular cannot resolve some dependency it throws an error and **@Optional()** prevents this behaviour and if you decorate your dependency with this resolution modifier **instead of error you will get just null**

**@Self()**:

@Self tries to resolve dependency only in its **own injector** and it **will not be asking the parent and go up through the injector tree** until it finds the provider.

It checks only its own injector and if it cannot resolve it there it will throw the error(null if @Optional is provided)

**@SkipSelf()**:

@SkipSelf is very simple and does just opposite thing of @Self it just skips(igonres) injector where it was declared and results dependencies starting from its parent injector.

**@Host()**
@Host() resolution modifier tells angular that the **host-element** should be the last stop when it is searching for provider.

Every component in angular has its own host-element and it is respresented by component's selector.

Common DI errors:

```
NullInjectorError: NullInjectorError: No provider for LoggerService!
```

```
ERROR NullInjectorError: R3InjectorError(AppModule)[LoggerService -> LoggerService -> LoggerService]:

```

```
ERROR Error: NG0201: No provider for LoggerService found in NodeInjector.
```
