The expanded provider configuration is an object literal with two properties:

- The `provide` property holds the token that serves as the key for both locating a dependency value and configuring the injector.
- The second property is a `provider definition object`, which tells the injector how to create the dependency value. The provider-definition key can be one of the following:
    1. __useClass__ - this option tells Angular DI to instantiate a provided class when a dependency is injected
    2. __useExisting__ - allows you to alias a token and reference any existing one.
    3. __useFactory__ - allows you to define a function that constructs a dependency.
    4. __useValue__ - provides a static value that should be used as a dependency.
